To convert each of the tasks into separate functions using for loops, you can define a function for each task and then call those functions as needed. Here's how you can structure the code:

1. Function to Determine the Total Number of Unique Departments
python
Copy code
def get_total_unique_departments(employees):
    departments = []
    for employee in employees:
        if employee["department"] not in departments:
            departments.append(employee["department"])
    return len(departments)

# Example usage
print(f"Total number of unique departments: {get_total_unique_departments(employees)}")
2. Function to List the Top 5 Highest-Paid Employees
python
Copy code
def get_top_5_highest_paid(employees):
    sorted_employees = sorted(employees, key=lambda x: x["salary"], reverse=True)
    return sorted_employees[:5]

# Example usage
top_5 = get_top_5_highest_paid(employees)
print("Top 5 highest-paid employees:")
for emp in top_5:
    print(emp["name"], emp["salary"])
3. Function to Compute the Average Monthly Salary
python
Copy code
def get_average_salary(employees):
    total_salary = 0
    for employee in employees:
        total_salary += employee["salary"]
    return total_salary / len(employees)

# Example usage
print(f"Average monthly salary: {get_average_salary(employees)}")
4. Function to Show the Number of Employees in Each Department
python
Copy code
def get_employees_per_department(employees):
    employees_per_department = {}
    for employee in employees:
        dept = employee["department"]
        if dept in employees_per_department:
            employees_per_department[dept] += 1
        else:
            employees_per_department[dept] = 1
    return employees_per_department

# Example usage
dept_counts = get_employees_per_department(employees)
print("Number of employees in each department:")
for dept, count in dept_counts.items():
    print(dept, count)
5. Function to Rank Employees by Salary Within Each Department
python
Copy code

            key=lambda x: x["salary"],
            reverse=True
        )
    return ranked_by_department

# Example usage
ranked_by_dept = rank_employees_by_department(employees)
print("Employees ranked by salary within each department:")
for dept, emps in ranked_by_dept.items():
    print(dept + ":")
    for emp in emps:
        print(emp["name"], emp["salary"])
6. Function to Calculate the Total Monthly Payroll Expense
python
Copy code
def get_total_payroll_expense(employees):
    total_payroll = 0
    for employee in employees:
        total_payroll += employee["salary"]
    return total_payroll

# Example usage
print(f"Total monthly payroll expense: {get_total_payroll_expense(employees)}")
7. Function to Find the Highest and Lowest Salary Employees
